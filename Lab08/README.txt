The sample text needs to have a space or an end line at the very end of the
document for it to register the last word properly. The output to file
only works properly if it is able to exit out of the program after writing
to the file. Only numbers will work in the choice of 1 to infinity. Any other
characters like alpha will endless loop the program. Tried to do an alpha
or number check but both failed with no success.
